ðŸŽ“ Junior at Cypress College, studying Computer Science	
     
ðŸ”­ Aspiring Machine Learning Engineer and Ph.D candidate in Machine Learning/Aritifical Intelligence

  I'm passionate about solving real-world problems through data analysis and predictive modeling. I'm committed to continuous 
  learn and take initiative to grow my skills with a focus on building machine learning models addressing real-world problems 
  and diving deeper into the intersection of data science, data privacy and ethical AI.
	
ðŸŽ¯ **Feature Project**: Unsupervised Machine Learning Identifying the most important factors in K-12 Student proficiency in subject areas.
- What we did: Created a merge data frame from 5 data frames regarding student data courses taken, demographics, etc, and used Principal
- Component Analysis and encoded our data for data reduction.
- Tools: PCA, Python,scikit-learn, Seaborn
- Result: Predicted up to 80% accuracy and provided insights that helped guide data-driven improvements to K-12 School Administrators.
